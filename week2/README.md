Project Overview

In Week 2, I focused on enhancing my skills by working with the Titanic dataset, exploring new libraries for better project management, and diving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. I also practiced version control by pushing my projects to GitHub.

Key Accomplishments:

Explored the Titanic Dataset: Conducted data analysis and preprocessing using Jupyter Notebook, honing skills in data manipulation and exploratory data analysis.
Learned New Python Libraries:
argparse: Used for command-line argument parsing to make scripts more versatile.
click: Simplified command-line interface creation.
logging: Implemented logging to monitor code execution and troubleshoot issues.
Applied OOP Concepts: Integrated Object-Oriented Programming principles to better structure code, making it modular and maintainable.
Version Control with Git: Pushed the project to GitHub, practicing good version control and collaboration readiness.

Technologies Used:
Python Libraries: argparse, click, logging
Jupyter Notebook: For data analysis and code execution.
Git & GitHub: For version control and project management.

How to Run the Week 2 Project:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/iamthedarksaint/week2.git

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Analysis Script:
If using argparse, execute the script with command-line arguments:
python analysis_script.py --file titanic.csv

Check the Logs:
Review the log file for details about the script execution.
